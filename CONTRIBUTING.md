## 🎨 Code Standards & Best Practices

### React/TypeScript Standards
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Proper TypeScript with interfaces
interface ProjectCardProps {
  project: {
    id: string
    name: string
    category: string
  }
}

export function ProjectCard({ project }: ProjectCardProps) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-4">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{project.name}</h3>
    </div>
  )
}

// ❌ Avoid: Any types and inline styles
export function ProjectCard({ project }: any) {
  return <div style={{background: 'white'}}>{project.name}</div>
}
```

### Styling with Tailwind CSS
```typescript
// ✅ Use existing design system colors
<button className="bg-uiuc-orange text-white hover:bg-uiuc-orange/90">
  Submit Project
</button>

// ✅ Follow responsive patterns
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {projects.map(project => <ProjectCard key={project.id} project={project} />)}
</div>
```

### Database/Supabase Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ Use typed database service
import { ProjectsService } from '@/lib/database'

const projects = await ProjectsService.getProjectsByCategory(categoryId)

// ✅ Handle errors gracefully
try {
  const result = await ProjectsService.createProject(projectData)
  if (result.error) {
    showErrorMessage(result.error.message)
    return
  }
  // Success handling
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Project creation failed:', error)
}
```
