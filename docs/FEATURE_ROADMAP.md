## Implementation Approach

**Phase 1 (COMPLETED - January 2025)**: ✅ Core user engagement features implemented (project details, comments, profiles, collections)

**Phase 2 (Current - 1-2 weeks)**: Complete remaining creator tools (project editing) and moderation features

**Phase 3 (Short-term - 1-2 months)**: Advanced search/discovery and admin tools for platform growth

**Phase 4 (Medium-term - 2-3 months)**: UIUC-specific features for competitive differentiation

**Phase 5 (Long-term - 3-6 months)**: Advanced platform capabilities for ecosystem expansion

**Technical Strategy**: Leverage existing Supabase infrastructure, maintain TypeScript quality standards, use existing shadcn/ui component system for consistency.
