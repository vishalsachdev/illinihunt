## Implementation Approach

**Phase 1 (Immediate - 2-3 weeks)**: Complete Priority 1 features to enhance user engagement

**Phase 2 (Short-term - 1-2 months)**: Build Priority 2 features for platform growth and moderation

**Phase 3 (Medium-term - 2-3 months)**: Develop UIUC-specific features for competitive differentiation

**Phase 4 (Long-term - 3-6 months)**: Advanced platform capabilities for ecosystem expansion

**Technical Strategy**: Leverage existing Supabase infrastructure, maintain TypeScript quality standards, use existing shadcn/ui component system for consistency.
