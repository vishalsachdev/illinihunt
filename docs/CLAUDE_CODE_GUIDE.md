## 📚 IlliniHunt Code Patterns

### **Component Development Pattern**
When creating new components, Claude follows IlliniHunt conventions:

```typescript
// Claude-generated component example
import React from 'react'
import { User } from '@/types/database'
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

interface UserAvatarProps {
  user: User
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  className?: string
}

export const UserAvatar: React.FC<UserAvatarProps> = ({ 
  user, 
  size = 'md', 
  className 
}) => {
  const sizeClasses = {
    sm: 'h-6 w-6',
    md: 'h-8 w-8',
    lg: 'h-12 w-12'
  }

  return (
    <img
      src={user.avatar_url || '/default-avatar.png'}
      alt={`${user.full_name || user.username}'s avatar`}
      className={cn(
        'rounded-full object-cover',
        sizeClasses[size],
        className
      )}
    />
  )
}
```

**Key Patterns Claude Follows:**
- TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Accessibility attributes (alt text, ARIA labels)
- Tailwind CSS with design system consistency
- Error handling and fallback values
- Responsive design considerations

### **Database Service Pattern**
Claude generates database services following IlliniHunt patterns:

```typescript
// Claude-generated service example
export class NotificationsService {
  static async getUserNotifications(userId: string): Promise<Notification[]> {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('notifications')
      .select(`
        id,
        type,
        message,
        read,
        created_at,
        projects (
          id,
          name,
          users (
            username,
            full_name
          )
        )
      `)
      .eq('user_id', userId)
      .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
      .limit(50)

    if (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching notifications:', error)
      throw error
    }

    return data || []
  }
}
```

**Service Layer Standards:**
- Proper error handling with logging
- TypeScript return type annotations
- Supabase query optimization
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive data relations
