# IlliniHunt Development Notes

## Project Overview
IlliniHunt V2 - A Product Hunt-style platform for the University of Illinois community to showcase projects, apps, and startups. Built with React + TypeScript + Supabase + Vercel.

## Recent Session Summary (2025-07-28)

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Hero Landing Page Implementation
- **Built full-screen hero section** with UIUC branding and professional design
- **Features implemented**:
  - Gradient background (UIUC blue to slate)
  - Subtle dot pattern overlay for visual texture
  - "Calling all Illini Builders" badge with lightning icon
  - Large compelling headline: "Showcase Your Innovation Built at UIUC"
  - Dual call-to-action buttons (Submit Project, Explore Projects)
  - Statistics section (150+ Community Projects, 50+ Active Builders, 25 Categories)
  - Smooth scroll indicator
- **Responsive design** with proper mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts

#### 2. Browser Auto-Resize Responsiveness Fix
- **Problem**: Page wasn't responding to browser window resize events
- **Root cause**: React components don't auto-re-render on window resize
- **Solution implemented**: 
  - Created `useWindowSize` hook with window resize event listeners
  - Integrated hook into HomePage component to force re-renders
  - Added proper viewport meta tag with `shrink-to-fit=no`
- **Result**: Page now dynamically adapts to browser window resizing

#### 3. Inclusive Language Updates
- **Updated all text** to welcome entire UIUC community, not just students
- **Changes made**:
  - Hero text: "University of Illinois community" instead of "students"
  - Subtitle: "Join students, faculty, and staff in building the future together"
  - Statistics: "Community Projects" instead of "Student Projects"
  - Auth message: "UIUC account" instead of "UIUC Google account"
  - Meta description: Explicitly mentions faculty and staff

#### 4. Authentication Improvements (User-Added)
- User pushed additional commit with enhanced authentication UX
- **New features**:
  - `AuthPromptProvider` context for better auth state management
  - `ProtectedRoute` component for cleaner route protection
  - Conditional authentication prompts with improved user experience
  - Better handling of redirect flow after authentication

### Technical Implementation Details

#### useWindowSize Hook
```typescript
export function useWindowSize(): WindowSize {
  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight,
  })

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleResize() {
      setWindowSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
      })
    }

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize)
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize)
  }, [])

  return windowSize
}
```

#### Key Responsive Classes Used
- Hero text: `text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl xl:text-7xl`
- Buttons: Full-width on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- Statistics: Always 3-column grid with responsive text sizes
- Container: Uses Tailwind's responsive container system

### File Changes Made
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Complete hero section redesign + responsive fixes
- `src/App.tsx` - Header transparency and mobile optimization
- `src/hooks/useWindowSize.ts` - New hook for resize responsiveness
- `src/index.css` - Enhanced CSS for responsive behavior
- `index.html` - Updated viewport and meta description

### Deployment
